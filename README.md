# Hackrush-22
We performed soft voting (which is a form of ensemble learning) on models of linear regression and SGD Regression to get an overall better model.
 
One key difference in our model from rest of the the submission was that we use concept of feature weigths, that is giving relative weights to the columns of the dataset. Here we decided these weights manually. Furthermore we expanded the features using label binarizer thus creating high dimensional features. Thus our model trained on this new set of features. This reduced the loss drastically.
